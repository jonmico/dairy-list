// TODO: Is this the best way to name/route to this?

/*
	TODO: Look at PopOver. Do we really need it? Maybe we just need a link to edit the list and a link to change the expiration on items.
	Or maybe we just need a general edit route where you can edit everything. I think it would be more user friendly to have a dedicated 
	interface/route to change the expiration status, and then another general edit route where you can edit not only expiration status, 
	but also name, expirationDate, etc.
